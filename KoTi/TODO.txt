* Finish removing old frontend (remaining: pictures and redirects)
* Pictures UI can be added in a very minimal form at first, without details view, possibility to move pictures around
  picture sets (folders), etc.  But those should still be re-added later
* Refactor backend, move code out of controllers
* Think about how to structure the frontend, perhaps readd a framework after all?  (not React)
