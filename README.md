This is the source code for `pohjoiseen.fi` websites.

* `Fennica3`: user-facing, very picture-heavy blog about Finland (https://fennica.pohjoiseen.fi/)
* `KoTi`: backoffice for Fennica3 and my private photo and location database.  Meant to be private,
  although should not hold anything truly sensitive
* `Holvi`: common backend for the previous two projects, for accessing their sqlite database and
  S3 storage for photos.

These are my main free-time projects (well, the biggest project is the actual blog content,
which these application support).  As such, the source is under GPL.
